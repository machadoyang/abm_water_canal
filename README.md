# ABM Water Canal

### Summary

This directory contains an ABM that simulates a water canal and users that withdraws water from it.
There are two notebooks. They contain the same information, one in english and other one in portuguese.
I am building a more robust model for my PhD Thesis that can be checked in this [other repository](https://github.com/machadoyang/irrigation_abm).

### How to run

We recommend installing anaconda, then installing mesa in the virtual environment.
Follow the instructions in notebooks

### Further reading

One paper based on this model is under submission process. Stay tuned.
